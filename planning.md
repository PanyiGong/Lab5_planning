The two objects that are interacting is a square and a circle.
When the object are touching, the distance between the center of the two shapes should be equal to radius of the circle plus width/height of the rectangle
I can use function to code:
If distance between circle x and rectangle x = radius of circle + width of rectangle, and circle x = radius of circle, direction flips
 dx= dx* -1, dy=dy*-1
if distance between circle y and rectangle y = radius of circle + height of rectangle, and circle y = radius circle. direction flips
