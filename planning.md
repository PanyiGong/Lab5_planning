The two objects that are interacting is a square and a circle.
When the object are touching, the distance between the edge of the block is zero. I can use if function to code:
If distance = 0, the direction flips.
When the distance between the size of the objects = 0, the direction of the object will change, dx= dx* -1, dy=dy*-1
