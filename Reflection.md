The challenging part of this lab is to picture what parameter should we use, and how to manipulate them to make them bounce off each other. 
At first, I find it challenging to map out what I should do to make a rectangle and a circle change direction. Unlike two circles, rectangle has different width and height.
In the end, I seperated the collision into horixontal collision and vertical collision. 
When distance between two centers is smaller than the radius plus width they change direction for horizontal. 
When distance between two centers is smaller than the radius plus height they change direction for vertical.
It makes mores sense how I can make them change direction when their distance is smaller than a value.
I'm proud that I figured out how to make the collision work for a rectangle and a circle!
